                <p>I'm a junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science.
                   I have experience teaching math and programming skills from being a Teaching Assistant at Northwestern,
                   and from my two years as a tech camp counselor, and I also am skilled at troubleshooting from my three years working at a tech helpdesk.
                   I'm experienced in multiple programming languages and have experience with CAD software.
                   I'm very comfortable with working in groups and with public speaking and giving presentations as well.
                    I'm looking forward to using my skills to make a difference in the world.</p>
